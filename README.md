# AI Mancala Project

This project uses PyTorch and evolutionary strategies to teach an agent to play Mancala.

This project implements the core logic for a two-player Mancala game, including move application, capture mechanics, game-over detection, and unit tests to validate the logic.

## Running the Game (Manual Play - if applicable)

```markdown
`game.py` defines the `Mancala` class and is not meant to be run directly.

## Running Unit Tests

All tests are located in `tests/test_game.py`.

To run them:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_game.py
